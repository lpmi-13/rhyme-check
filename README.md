# Rhyme-Check

This is a very simple micromaterial created for the Oxford [Summer of Hacks](https://summerofhacks.io) [Language Hack Day](https://summerofhacks.io/#2019:3-language-hackday).

The aim is to give learners practice in converting from regular text to [IPA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Phonetic_Alphabet), and then to finding
single syllable rhymes using IPA.
